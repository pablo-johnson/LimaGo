#Lima-Go

This is a personal project where I can apply new technologies, concepts and good practices.
The idea is to list common entities from Lima like police stations, firefighter stations, schools, ministries or any other kind of entity of public interest.
The main approach in order to develop this app is to build thinking in an offline app but making it to work online (read references to know more about this).

For this, I am in the process of implementing a **Clean Architecture** using patterns like **MVP** (already applied) for the design layer or **Repository** (TODO) in the data layer.

These are some of the common libraries used:

 - Dagger: Used to inject dependencies (in progress).
 - Butterknife: Automatically bind views and cast to the respective View in the layout.
 - gSon: Used to parse json from data sources.
 - Retrofit: To communicate with web services (TODO).
 - RXAndroid: To manage data flow (TODO)
